# Housing-Price-Prediction

Problem Statsment: -
Houses are one of the necessary need of each and every person around the globe and therefore housing and real estate market is one of the markets which is one of the major contributors in the world’s economy. It is a very large market and there are various companies working in the domain. Data science comes as a very important tool to solve problems in the domain to help the companies increase their overall revenue, profits, improving their marketing strategies and focusing on changing trends in house sales and purchases. Predictive modelling, Market mix modelling, recommendation systems are some of the machine learning techniques used for achieving the business goals for housing companies. Our problem is related to one such housing company. A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy houses to enter the market. You are required to build a model using Machine Learning in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. For this company wants to know: • Which variables are important to predict the price of variable? • How do these variables describe the price of the house?


Business Goal: -
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for the management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Keys Observation:-
From this Project i understand on which features price is affected and on which price not and observed many things:

As the Living area increases price also increases.

As Basement Are increases price also increases.

Price of the house having high Garagearea having high price.

Most of the people like Gas Base Furnace heating and its price is also high

Kitchen Quality-Excellent price is high.

As No of FirePlaces increases price also increases.

Room above the ground as room increases price increases but after the incremnet of 12 price decareses.

Limitation Learning Outcomes and Future Scope
As this model is based on Australian Market only this model you can not apply globally.

From this model i learn many things and for this model Tree base algorithm is mostly use.

Here dataset is small so i used KFold Value 5 but if for big dataset KFold Value will be 10.

Here Data set having also many missing values and for future score if i provide geological data like longitute and Latitude than i can visualize on Map so it will be more easy to under stand and having more impact.
